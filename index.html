    <p2> About Me </p2> <br>
<br>
  <p1> Hello, my name is Jonathan Loftus and I am a freshman at the University at Buffalo studying Computer Engineering.
      I initially became interested in computers while I was a sophomore in High School when I built a computer to play games on.
    Since then I've realized learning about and building computers was a passion of mine and that's why I'm majoring in Computer Engineering.
  I'm also interested in many other things related to computers such as software development, game design, and 3D printing.

  A few things outside of my interest in computers that I like to do are:
  <ul>
    <li> Ski and Snowboard
    <li> Skateboard and Longboard
    <li> Listen to music
    <li> Play League of Legends
    <li> Hangout with friends
    <li> Watch Netflix
    <li> Go hunting, camping, and hiking
    <li> Run spartan races
  </ul>
