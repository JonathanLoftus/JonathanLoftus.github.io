  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <p id="first-paragraph">I really have no idea what I am doing to be honest.</p>
	<p>I’m Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss.
           Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I’ve learned after 21 years – you never know WHAT is gonna come through that door.</p>
